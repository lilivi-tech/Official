Important: Please read these Terms carefully. The Services are not available to persons under 13 (or under 16 in certain jurisdictions). If you are between 13 (or 16 where applicable) and 18, you must have your legal guardian’s permission to use the Services.

## Scope & Incorporation

These Terms are between you and Xiamen Lilivi Technology Co., Ltd. (“Lilivi”, “we”, “us”) for your use of our websites, apps, and related offerings (the “Services”). These Terms incorporate our Privacy Policy and other terms referenced on the Site. We may update these Terms at our discretion. Continued use constitutes acceptance; if you do not agree, stop using the Services.

## Definitions

“Content” means text, audio, photos, images, video, graphics, and other materials posted, generated, or otherwise made available via the Services. “Lilivi Content” means Content provided by Lilivi (e.g., filters, fonts, templates, effects, stickers, backgrounds, music templates). “User Content” means Content uploaded or provided by users, excluding Lilivi Content.

## Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Site, software, or Services, you agree to these Terms. If you violate any provision, your authorization automatically terminates and you must cease use and remove any Software downloaded or printed.

## Copyright

Unless otherwise noted, the Software and Services are protected works and intellectual property of Lilivi and/or its licensors. No portion of the Site’s content may be reproduced without Lilivi’s prior written consent.

## Use of Software and Services

Any Software accompanied by a license agreement may only be used if you agree to that agreement; otherwise, you may not use the Software. Unauthorized duplication is an infringement and may constitute a crime. Refer to the applicable License Agreement for details.

## Eligibility & Non‑Commercial Use

Use the Services reasonably and lawfully. Unless otherwise stated in a separate license, you may view, share, store, use, transmit, and post content only for personal, non‑commercial purposes. You may not transfer your rights under these Terms without Lilivi’s prior written consent.

## Software Sign‑up

By creating an account with Lilivi, you agree your use of the account is governed by these Terms and any additional terms referenced on the Site.

## Subscription

Fees (“Subscription”) are stated in the apps or on the Site and may vary by location. Subscriptions are generally non‑refundable except as set forth in the applicable terms or as required by law. Each party bears its own taxes under applicable laws.

We do not offer direct website checkout. In‑app subscriptions are billed and managed by Apple App Store and Google Play. If renewal payment fails, update payment details in the respective store to maintain access. Unless you cancel auto‑renewal at least 24 hours before the end of your current billing cycle (or as the platform requires), your Subscription will automatically renew and the store will charge the then‑applicable fees and taxes.

You may not cancel and obtain a refund for the then‑current period unless you provide supporting documents showing you have not used the Software or Services, and Lilivi determines, in its sole discretion, that your request is sufficient. See our [Refund Policy](/en/refund) for details.

### Cancellation & Auto‑Renewal

You can cancel at any time via your account billing page or the app store subscription center; cancellation takes effect at the end of the paid period. Deleting an app does not cancel a subscription. Unless a specific withdrawal right applies in your jurisdiction, payments are non‑refundable and no credits are issued for partial periods.

### App Store / Google Play Subscriptions

In‑app subscriptions purchased via Apple App Store / Google Play are billed and managed by the respective stores (we do not handle full card data). Manage cancellations in the App Store / Google Play subscription center. Deleting the app does not cancel a subscription; cancellation usually takes effect at the end of the paid period. Refunds are handled according to the store’s terms; we cannot directly refund store orders. See our Refund Policy for details. If a free trial is offered, it may convert to a paid plan at the end of the trial unless cancelled in time per store rules.

## Virtual Goods & AI Features

We may charge for premium assets or features (“Virtual Goods”). Subject to applicable terms, we grant a limited, personal, revocable, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable license to use Virtual Goods within the Services. You may not transfer/resell/redistribute or use them as standalone files or in prohibited contexts (e.g., defamatory, deceptive, obscene, illegal). We may change, regulate, or remove Virtual Goods in accordance with law.

AI features may rely on third‑party models. AI‑generated content may be inaccurate or inappropriate; evaluate for your use. We disclaim warranties for AI outputs and are not responsible for consequences of reliance. Do not use AI features to violate rights or laws. Additional terms may apply to AI features (see the AI Terms of Use).

## Limitations

We may accept or refuse any Subscription application at our discretion. You may not transfer or assign your Subscription or any benefits (including promotional codes, digital assets) except as allowed. Do not share your login credentials. The Site, Software, and Services may be unavailable during maintenance, upgrades, or network failures beyond Lilivi’s control.

## Trial Use

We may offer trial or promotional use subject to these Terms unless otherwise stated. You may choose not to continue or to upgrade to a paid plan at the end of the trial.

### Cooling‑off / Right of Withdrawal (where applicable)

In certain jurisdictions (e.g., EEA/UK), consumers may have a 14‑day right of withdrawal from the start of a subscription, if required by law and if you have not begun using the paid features or have not expressly agreed to immediate provision of digital content during the cooling‑off period. To exercise, email [support@lilivi.com](mailto:support@lilivi.com) with a clear statement within 14 days. If you ask us to begin immediately or have already used paid features, the right may not apply as permitted by local law.

## App License

Subject to these Terms, Lilivi grants you a limited, royalty‑free, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable license to download and install the apps on a device you own or control for personal, non‑commercial use (unless otherwise permitted). You may not reverse engineer, distribute, rent, or make the app available to multiple users.

## Acceptable Use & User Content

You must use the Services reasonably and lawfully. Unless otherwise stated in a separate license, you may view, share, store, use, transmit, and post content only for personal, non‑commercial purposes. You may not transfer your rights under these Terms without Lilivi’s prior written consent.

You agree not to use the Services for any illegal or prohibited purpose, including but not limited to: harassment, intimidation, hate speech, incitement to violence or crime, discrimination, or personal attacks; infringement of portrait, reputation, privacy, or IP rights; sexually explicit content, child exploitation, gambling, narcotics, weapons, terrorism/extremism; impersonation, deceptive deepfakes, removal/tampering of rights notices; unauthorized advertising, solicitations, spam, fraud, phishing; unauthorized scraping, reverse engineering, bypassing access controls, imposing unreasonable load or interfering with the Services; malware, viruses, trojans, backdoors; unauthorized collection/disclosure/trade of others’ personal information (e.g., IDs, bank cards, contact details). Where applicable (e.g., US), ensure you do not upload data classified as sensitive by local law.

License to user content: you grant us a limited, worldwide, non‑exclusive, revocable, royalty‑free license to host, store, process, transcode, transmit, display and back up your user content solely to provide and improve the Services and enable features you select. Unless agreed otherwise, we do not claim ownership of your user content.

## Passwords & Account Access

You are responsible for activities under your account. Maintain control of devices used to access the Services and keep your password confidential. Keep account information accurate and up‑to‑date. We may terminate, suspend, or place an account on hold to protect users, us, and partners from identity theft or fraud.

## Indemnity

You will indemnify and hold harmless Lilivi, its affiliates, and service providers (and their officers, directors, employees, and agents) from any claims, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your acts or omissions, your content, or your violation of law or these Terms.

## Disclaimer

We are not obligated to monitor user content. We may remove, edit, screen, or block user content at any time, including content we deem to violate these Terms. You may be exposed to content that is offensive, inaccurate, or indecent and you agree not to make claims against us arising from such content. While we strive for high quality, limitations in inputs, technology, or artistic complexity may affect outcomes; we do not warrant accuracy or sufficiency of generated results.

## Termination by Lilivi

We may terminate your license at our discretion without notice. Where termination is unrelated to your breach, we may offer a prorated refund of full months remaining. We will not refund termination due to violations, fraud, misuse, or conduct harmful to Lilivi or others. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver.

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LILIVI OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE, SOFTWARE, OR SERVICES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE LAST SUBSCRIPTION FEE YOU PAID. THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SURVIVE TERMINATION.

## Third‑Party Services & Links

We are not responsible for third‑party actions, content, products, or services. Links are for convenience. You assume all risks for using third‑party resources.

## Force Majeure

We are not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond our reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, network outages, attacks, system instability).

## Modification, Suspension & Termination

We may modify, suspend, or terminate the Services or your access at any time as permitted by law. Back up your data. Sections that by their nature should survive will survive.

## IP Infringement Notices

If you believe material in the Services infringes your rights, email support@lilivi.com with: (i) your contact details; (ii) identification of the copyrighted or other work claimed to be infringed; (iii) identification of the material claimed to be infringing (URL if available); (iv) a statement of good‑faith belief that use is not authorized; and (v) a statement that the information is accurate and you are authorized to act.

## Severability; Assignment; Entire Agreement

If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in full force. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent; we may assign per law. These Terms (including referenced documents) constitute the entire agreement between you and Lilivi regarding the Services.

## Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of the People’s Republic of China (excluding conflict‑of‑laws rules). Disputes will first be resolved amicably; failing that, submitted to the competent court where Lilivi is located.

## Inherent Risks

Internet‑based services carry inherent risks (e.g., hardware/software/network failures, malicious software, data loss, unauthorized access). You assume these risks to the extent permitted by law.
