    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Modified:</strong> October 10, 2025</p>

    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Policy explains how Xiamen Lilivi Technology Co., Ltd. (“Lilivi”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, stores, discloses and protects information about you when you use Lilivi websites, mobile/desktop apps, and related services (our “Services”). By using the Services, you agree to this Policy and our processing as described. If you do not agree, please do not use the Services.</p>

    <h2>Website Purchases</h2>
    <p>When you purchase or use the Product on our Site, we may collect and store: (i) email and password if you sign up directly (or third‑party account basic info if you use single sign‑on); (ii) payment‑related details as described below; (iii) your country information; (iv) account identifiers necessary to activate the Product, provide support, process refunds per the Refund Policy, manage upgrade pricing, and send Product‑only information.</p>
    <p>Country of residence may be used to calculate indirect taxes (e.g., VAT) where legally required.</p>

    <h3>Data Security & Storage (Website Purchase)</h3>
    <p>Purchase data is transmitted over HTTPS (SSL) and stored in secured systems accessible only to authorized Lilivi personnel and contracted technical providers. While we take strong measures to protect your information, no Internet transmission is 100% secure. Once received, we apply industry safeguards (e.g., TLS, firewalls, access controls) to protect your data.</p>
    <p>Your email may also be stored by a reputable email service provider to deliver updates and Product communications. You can manage preferences or request removal. To request deletion, contact <a href="mailto:support@lilivi.com">support@lilivi.com</a>; we generally process within 72 hours.</p>
    <p>We do not sell or make available your data to unrelated third parties.</p>

    <h3>Payment Information (Website Purchase)</h3>
    <p>When purchasing, certain details (e.g., location, postal code, cardholder name, card number, expiry date, security code) are transmitted securely to our payment processor for authorization. Lilivi does not process or store full card numbers. For receipts and support, we may store limited payment metadata (e.g., country, currency, amount, time, last 4 digits, taxes paid).</p>

    <h2>Your Account</h2>
    <h3>Collection & Storage</h3>
    <p>We may ask for your email when you: purchase, download a trial, sign up, or request support. Emails are transmitted via HTTPS and stored in Lilivi systems restricted to authorized personnel/contractors. You can unsubscribe or request removal at <a href="mailto:support@lilivi.com">support@lilivi.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>User Account & Product Activation</h3>
    <p>Most Products require an account (email or phone) with a password meeting minimum complexity. Passwords are encrypted and not visible to Lilivi personnel. The account serves as your license and is required for activation and ongoing use.</p>

    <h3>Email Usage & Consent</h3>
    <p>You can opt‑in/out of newsletters, offers, and member‑only notifications at any time using links in our emails or by contacting support. For jurisdictions requiring double‑opt‑in (e.g., parts of the EU), additional confirmations may apply.</p>

    <h3>Technical & Support Emails</h3>
    <p>We may use your account email for essential technical updates and to follow up on support tickets. These may not include automated opt‑out, but you can request removal via support.</p>

    <h2>Application Usage Analytics</h2>
    <p>With your consent, some Products may collect anonymized usage analytics (e.g., feature usage patterns) to inform product improvements. You can opt out in the Product settings after installation.</p>

    <h2>Log Information</h2>
    <p>When you use certain Services, we may automatically collect logs (e.g., usage frequency, device statistics, error/crash data, language, time zone) to improve reliability. Logs are not used to individually identify users.</p>

    <h2>Our Website and Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and hosted tracking to understand Site usage and improve navigation. See our Cookie Policy and Cookie Settings for details and controls.</p>

    <h2>Application‑Specific Content & Updates</h2>
    <p>Some Products may personalize in‑app content based on membership status. Products may periodically check for available updates (new features, bug fixes); you can choose when to install.</p>

    <h2>Device & Identifier Information (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>When using our mobile apps, we may collect device information for functionality, analytics and security, such as device model, OS version, app version, language/region, network type, and device identifiers (e.g., IDFA/GAID/IDFV/OAID where permitted). Some features may request additional permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Photos/Albums: to upload, edit and save content.</li>
      <li>Pasteboard: to detect preset commands you invoke.</li>
      <li>Camera/Microphone: for capture and editing features you enable.</li>
      <li>Advertising identifiers: for analytics/attribution where permitted; you can opt‑out in system settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Opt‑Out Options</h2>
    <p>You can disable cross‑app tracking and analytics in system settings and/or Product settings where available. Contact support if you need assistance.</p>

    <h2>Your Content</h2>
    <p>Where on‑device capabilities are insufficient, we may upload your content to our servers for processing and to streamline future editing. For product improvement, we may (with your permission where required) analyze uploaded content. You may disable content collection in settings; doing so may limit certain features.</p>

    <h2>Protecting Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We may engage trusted providers (e.g., technical consultants, order fulfillment, customer support) who receive only the data needed to perform their services and are contractually prohibited from using it for other purposes. We may also present contests or promotions with partners, where you choose whether to share your data. We may disclose information when required by law.</p>

    <h2>Sharing Personal Information & Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with affiliates/partners/solution providers to deliver Services (e.g., infrastructure, email, analytics, payments, identity verification) under strict contractual safeguards. Examples of analytics/ads/cloud providers sometimes used in the industry include Mixpanel, Google, Meta, TikTok, affiliate networks, and cloud providers (e.g., AWS). If identity verification is required, we may use a provider to validate phone numbers; such data is deleted as soon as practical after verification unless retention is legally required.</p>

    <h2>Bases for Using Your Information</h2>
    <p>We process personal information only where we have lawful bases, typically: (i) your consent; (ii) performance of a contract (to operate the Services); (iii) our legitimate interests (e.g., service improvement, security) balanced against your rights; and (iv) legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Data Processing, Transfer & Analysis</h2>
    <p>By using the Services, you acknowledge your data may be processed in countries/regions where we or our providers operate (e.g., the United States). Safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses, encryption, anonymization, backups) are applied as required by applicable law. If your content includes third‑party personal data, you must have lawful authorization to disclose it to us.</p>

    <h2>Operational, Safety, and Abuse Review</h2>
    <p>We may automatically and/or manually review public or shared cloud content for safety (e.g., CSAM, violence, explicit content) and intellectual‑property concerns. Illegal or abusive content may be blocked and escalated.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Request access, correction, deletion, portability (where applicable).</li>
      <li>Opt‑out of certain processing (e.g., marketing), withdraw consent, and manage cookies.</li>
      <li>Request details about what we collect, how we use it, and with whom we share it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exercise rights by emailing <a href="mailto:support@lilivi.com">support@lilivi.com</a>. We do not discriminate for exercising privacy rights. If denied, you may appeal by contacting us.</p>

    <h3>Region‑Specific Addenda</h3>
    <p>Where required by local law (e.g., GDPR in the EEA/UK; CCPA/CPRA in California; LGPD in Brazil), you may have additional rights such as objecting to processing, restricting processing, not being subject to certain profiling, and the right to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority. We honor such rights as applicable.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect data from children under the age required by local law (e.g., under 16). If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will delete it consistent with law.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We maintain technical and organizational safeguards (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls, least‑privilege). However, no transmission or storage is 100% secure. You use the Services at your own risk; please protect your account credentials.</p>

    <h2>Information Access & Control</h2>
    <p>Where available, you can access, update, or delete certain information in account settings, or by contacting us. We may verify your identity before fulfilling requests to protect your account.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information as long as necessary for the purposes described (e.g., providing the Services, legal compliance, dispute resolution). When no longer needed, we delete or anonymize it, subject to lawful retention requirements.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>Updates will be posted on this page and, where possible, we will also notify you by email. Continued use signifies acceptance of changes.</p>
