    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Modified:</strong> August 5, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Please read these Terms carefully. The Services are not available to persons under 13 (or under 16 in certain jurisdictions). If you are between 13 (or 16 where applicable) and 18, you must have your legal guardian’s permission to use the Services.</p>

    <h2>Scope & Incorporation</h2>
    <p>These Terms are between you and Xiamen Lilivi Technology Co., Ltd. (“Lilivi”, “we”, “us”) for your use of our websites, apps, and related offerings (the “Services”). These Terms incorporate our Privacy Policy and other terms referenced on the Site. We may update these Terms at our discretion. Continued use constitutes acceptance; if you do not agree, stop using the Services.</p>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p>“Content” means text, audio, photos, images, video, graphics, and other materials posted, generated, or otherwise made available via the Services. “Lilivi Content” means Content provided by Lilivi (e.g., filters, fonts, templates, effects, stickers, backgrounds, music templates). “User Content” means Content uploaded or provided by users, excluding Lilivi Content.</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>Xiamen Lilivi Technology Co., Ltd. (“Lilivi”, “we”) makes available this website (the “Site”), certain software, documentation, and related materials (collectively, the “Software”), and various services (the “Services”), subject to these Terms of Use (“Terms”). By accessing or using the Site, the Software, or the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you violate any provision, your authorization to use the Site, Software, and Services automatically terminates and you must immediately cease use and remove any Software downloaded or printed.</p>

    <h2>Copyright</h2>
    <p>Unless otherwise noted, the Software and Services are protected works and intellectual property of Lilivi and/or its licensors. No portion of the Site’s content may be reproduced without Lilivi’s prior written consent.</p>

    <h2>Use of Software and Services</h2>
    <p>The Software and Services available on or from the Site are copyrighted works of Lilivi and/or its licensors. Any Software accompanied by a license agreement may only be used if you agree to that agreement; otherwise, you may not use the Software. Unauthorized duplication is an infringement and may constitute a crime. Refer to the applicable Licensing Agreement for details.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility & Non‑Commercial Use</h2>
    <p>You must use the Services reasonably and lawfully. Unless otherwise stated in a separate license, you may view, share, store, use, transmit, and post content only for personal, non‑commercial purposes. You may not transfer your rights under these Terms without Lilivi’s prior written consent.</p>

    <h2>Software Sign‑up</h2>
    <p>By creating an account with Lilivi, you agree that your use of the account is governed by these Terms and any additional terms, conditions, limitations, and requirements referenced or linked on the Site, which are incorporated by reference.</p>

    <h2>Subscription</h2>
    <p>The Software is not free of charge. Fees (“Subscription”) are stated in the Software or on the Site and may vary by location. Subscriptions are generally non‑refundable except as set forth in the applicable terms or as required by law. Each party bears its own taxes as required by applicable tax laws.</p>
    <p>Accepted payment methods include credit cards and PayPal; local methods may be offered depending on your location. If renewal payment fails, you must update payment details to maintain access. Unless you cancel auto‑renewal at least 24 hours before the end of your current billing cycle (or as the platform requires), your Subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to charge the then‑applicable fees and taxes.</p>
    <p>You may not cancel and obtain a refund for the then‑current period unless you provide supporting documents showing you have not used the Software or Services, and Lilivi determines, in its sole discretion, that your request is sufficient. See our Refund Policy for details.</p>

    <h3>Cancellation & Auto‑Renewal</h3>
    <p>You can cancel at any time via your account billing page or the app store subscription center; cancellation takes effect at the end of the paid period. Deleting an app does not cancel a subscription. Unless a specific withdrawal right applies in your jurisdiction, payments are non‑refundable and no credits are issued for partial periods.</p>

    <h2>Virtual Goods & AI Features</h2>
    <p>We may charge for premium assets or features (“Virtual Goods”). Subject to applicable terms, we grant a limited, personal, revocable, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable license to use Virtual Goods within the Services. You may not transfer Virtual Goods, resell, redistribute, or use them as standalone files or in prohibited contexts (e.g., defamatory, deceptive, obscene, illegal). We may change, regulate, or remove Virtual Goods at any time in accordance with law.</p>
    <p>AI features may rely on third‑party models. AI‑generated content may be inaccurate or inappropriate; evaluate for your use. We disclaim warranties for AI outputs and are not responsible for consequences of your reliance. Do not use AI features to violate rights or laws.</p>
    <p>Additional terms may apply to AI features. See the <a href="/en/ai-terms">AI Terms of Use</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>We may accept or refuse any Subscription application at our discretion. You may not transfer or assign your Subscription or any benefits (including promotional codes, digital assets) except as allowed. Members may not purchase or distribute benefits for resale, rental, or sharing. Do not share your login credentials. The Site, Software, and Services may be unavailable during maintenance, upgrades, or network failures beyond Lilivi’s control.</p>

    <h2>Trial Use</h2>
    <p>We may offer trial or promotional use subject to these Terms unless otherwise stated. You may choose not to continue or to upgrade to a paid plan at the end of the trial.</p>

    <h2>Agreement Changes</h2>
    <p>We may change these Terms and our Privacy Policy in our discretion. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Site, Software, and Services.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use & User Content</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the Site, Software, or Services for unlawful or prohibited purposes, including without limitation: harassment; infringing, defamatory, obscene, or abusive content; illegal activities; spam; automated scraping without permission; overloading infrastructure; interfering with operations; bypassing access controls; unsolicited advertising; malware; or other harmful code. If you are in the United States, you must ensure your content does not include sensitive data as defined by applicable regulations (e.g., PADFA).</p>
    <p>You are responsible for your content. Do not post content involving gambling, violence, discrimination, explicit sexual content, doxxing, impersonation, or violations of others’ rights (privacy, publicity, IP). We may (but are not obligated to) monitor, remove, or disable content to operate the Services, enforce these Terms, and comply with law.</p>

    <h2>Content Ownership & Licenses</h2>
    <p>We do not claim ownership in your content. You grant Lilivi a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, use, reproduce, adapt, modify, communicate, display, perform, distribute, and create derivative works as necessary to operate, provide, optimize, and promote the Services. You represent you have all rights and consents needed for such use.</p>
    <p>Lilivi and its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to the Services and Lilivi Content, protected by applicable IP laws. Do not remove or obscure notices. If you incorporate Lilivi Content into User Content, we retain all rights in Lilivi Content and derivatives thereof.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>Ads may appear in the Services to support operations. We are not the supplier of third‑party products/services advertised and do not warrant them. Verify claims before transacting; we are not liable for resulting transactions except as required by law.</p>

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>By submitting feedback, you grant Lilivi a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty‑free license to use and exploit it for any purpose.</p>

    <h2>App License</h2>
    <p>Subject to these Terms, Lilivi grants you a limited, royalty‑free, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, non‑sublicensable license to download and install the apps on a device you own or control for personal, non‑commercial use (unless otherwise permitted). You may not reverse engineer, distribute, rent, or make the app available to multiple users.</p>

    <h2>Passwords & Account Access</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for activities under your account. Maintain control of devices used to access the Services and keep your password confidential. Keep account information accurate and up‑to‑date. We may terminate, suspend, or place an account on hold to protect users, us, and partners from identity theft or fraud.</p>

    <h2>Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You will indemnify and hold harmless Lilivi, its affiliates, and service providers (and their officers, directors, employees, and agents) from any claims, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of your acts or omissions, your content, or your violation of law or these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>We are not obligated to monitor user content. We may remove, edit, screen, or block user content at any time, including content we deem to violate these Terms. You may be exposed to content that is offensive, inaccurate, or indecent and you agree not to make claims against us arising from such content. While we strive for high quality (e.g., color‑matching features), limitations in inputs, technology, or artistic complexity may affect outcomes; we do not warrant accuracy or sufficiency of generated results.</p>

    <h2>Termination by Lilivi</h2>
    <p>We may terminate your license at our discretion without notice. Where termination is unrelated to your breach, we may offer a prorated refund of FULL months remaining. We will not refund termination due to violations, fraud, misuse, or conduct harmful to Lilivi or others. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LILIVI OR ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR SIMILAR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SITE, SOFTWARE, OR SERVICES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE LAST SUBSCRIPTION FEE YOU PAID. THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND SURVIVE TERMINATION.</p>

    <h2>Third‑Party Services & Links</h2>
    <p>We are not responsible for third‑party actions, content, products, or services. Links are for convenience. You assume all risks for using third‑party resources.</p>

    <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>We are not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond our reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, network outages, attacks, system instability).</p>

    <h2>Modification, Suspension & Termination</h2>
    <p>We may modify, suspend, or terminate the Services or your access at any time as permitted by law. Back up your data. Sections that by their nature should survive will survive.</p>

    <h2>IP Infringement Notices</h2>
    <p>If you believe material in the Services infringes your rights, email <a href="mailto:support@lilivi.com">support@lilivi.com</a> with: (i) your contact details; (ii) identification of the copyrighted or other work claimed to be infringed; (iii) identification of the material claimed to be infringing (URL if available); (iv) a statement of good‑faith belief that use is not authorized; and (v) a statement that the information is accurate and you are authorized to act.</p>

    <h2>Severability; Assignment; Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in full force. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent; we may assign per law. These Terms (including referenced documents) constitute the entire agreement between you and Lilivi regarding the Services.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the People’s Republic of China (excluding conflict‑of‑laws rules). Disputes will first be resolved amicably; failing that, submitted to the competent court where Lilivi is located.</p>

    <h2>Inherent Risks</h2>
    <p>You understand Internet‑based services carry inherent risks (e.g., hardware/software/network failures, malicious software, data loss, unauthorized access). You assume these risks to the extent permitted by law.</p>
