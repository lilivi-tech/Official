These AI Terms of Use (the “AI Terms”) supplement the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and govern your use of Lilivi’s AI features (“AI Features”). If these AI Terms conflict with the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy with respect to the AI Features, these AI Terms control.

## Privacy

We are dedicated to protecting your privacy. Content you upload through AI Features (e.g., photos, audio, text prompts) will not be used to identify you individually. See the Privacy Policy for details on data collection, processing, retention, and your choices.

## Non‑commercial use (unless otherwise licensed)

Unless expressly permitted under a separate commercial license, you may use the AI Features, including generated outputs, for personal, non‑commercial purposes only and must comply with applicable laws.

## Grant of rights

To operate and improve the AI Features, you grant Lilivi a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license (with the right to sublicense) to store, use, copy, adapt, modify, communicate, display, perform, distribute, and create derivative works from: (i) inputs (e.g., vocal/text/image cues) and (ii) outputs, as necessary to provide the AI Features, monitor and prevent abuse, and improve AI functionality. If you do not agree, please do not use the AI Features.

## Your responsibility

You are solely responsible for your content and represent you have the rights and consents required. Do not use AI Features to infringe IP, privacy, publicity or other rights, or to violate laws/policies.

## Limitations of use

Except as allowed by law, you may not: (i) copy, modify or create derivative works of the AI Features; (ii) distribute, transfer, sublicense, lease, lend or rent the AI Features; (iii) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble; (iv) make the AI Features available to multiple users; (v) scrape or extract data; or (vi) use the AI Features or their outputs to build, train, or improve (directly or indirectly) any other AI service.

## Accuracy & appropriateness

AI outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, inappropriate, or contain errors. Evaluate outputs before use. Do not rely on outputs as a sole source of truth or as a substitute for professional advice. Your use (commercial or private) is at your own risk; Lilivi disclaims all warranties for AI outputs.

## Deletion of user content

Lilivi may delete any user content generated via the AI Features at its discretion at any time without notice and without liability.

## Miscellaneous

Sections on Indemnity, Limitation of Liability, Third‑Party Services & Links, Force Majeure, Modification/Suspension/Termination, Governing Law & Disputes, and IP Infringement Notices in the Terms of Use apply to these AI Terms.
