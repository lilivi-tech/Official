This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how Xiamen Lilivi Technology Co., Ltd. (“Lilivi”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, shares, stores, and protects information when you use our websites, mobile/desktop apps, and related features (the “Services”), and describes your rights across jurisdictions. By using the Services, you agree to this Policy. If you do not agree, please stop using the Services.

Questions? Contact: [support@lilivi.com](mailto:support@lilivi.com) (please include “Privacy” in the subject).

## 1. Scope and necessary data

- Applies to information we collect or receive when you use the Services; not to independent third parties.
- “Personal information” means information that identifies or can reasonably identify a natural person.
- Some data are necessary to provide the Services (as indicated at collection). Refusing to provide such data may limit features.

## 2. Information we collect

To deliver, secure, and improve the Services, we may collect:

1. Account and subscriptions

- Required: email/phone (registration, login, verification); device identifier (e.g., device ID)
- Optional: display name, avatar, gender, date of birth, region/language
- Subscription/purchase metadata: order status, amount, currency, time, taxes, last 4 digits (if applicable). We do not store full card numbers; complete payment data are processed by app stores or payment processors.

2. Device and network

- Device: model, OS version, resolution, and (where applicable) identifiers (IDFA/GAID/IDFV/OAID/Android ID/IMEI/MAC)
- Network: operator, network type, Wi‑Fi name, coarse location, session duration, IP, system time zone

3. Location

- Required: country/region code and system country (for versioning/localization)
- Optional (with permission): latitude/longitude, network location, network information, IP address, and system time zone
- Purposes: correct versioning, location features (e.g., geo‑tagging), risk control, and compliance statistics. You can withdraw permission in OS settings. Even with location disabled, we may still receive signals like IP and time zone as part of network communications.

4. Logs and analytics

- Usage frequency, key paths, errors/crashes, language/time zone, for stability and quality; not used to directly identify you.

5. Content processing (if you choose these features)

- Image/video cloud editing: uploading is needed to return results; EXIF (device model, parameters, timestamp, possibly GPS) may be present.
- Voice: microphone input for dubbing/editing; not used for advertising.
- Metadata and facial features: to enable face detection/key‑points/segmentation/stickers/beauty/AR, we may compute technical data locally or in the cloud. Facial mapping is discarded when the recommendation ends or the app closes; not used to identify specific persons; not shared with third parties.

6. Cookies/SDKs and advertising IDs

- Cookies/local storage: session, preferences, A/B flags, basic analytics.
- Third‑party SDKs: may support crash analytics, attribution, helpdesk, cloud/CDN, and (with consent) advertising/measurement.
- Advertising: ad IDs (e.g., IDFA/GAID/OAID), coarse location, IP, in‑app interactions; for frequency capping, deduplication, measurement, and anti‑fraud. You can limit personalized ads in OS/app settings (where provided).

7. Website payment information (not applicable)

- We do not offer direct website checkout at this time. In‑app subscriptions are billed and managed by Apple App Store and Google Play. We do not process full cardholder data.

## 3. How we use information

- Provide and maintain Services: account, features, support, and notifications
- Security and risk control: anomaly detection, anti‑fraud, debugging, and audit
- Statistics and optimization: product/performance improvements (you may opt out of optional analytics)
- Location‑based features: with permission, to enable context and correct versioning
- Identity verification: SMS/email/device checks to prevent unauthorized access
- Compliance: responding to regulators, law enforcement, and disputes
- Other purposes with your consent or as disclosed at collection

## 4. Sharing and disclosure

We do not sell your personal information. We may share on a need‑to‑know basis:

- Service providers/processors: cloud/storage, crash/analytics, payments/orders, helpdesk, content moderation/security, and (with consent) ads/attribution
- Legal/compliance: to comply with law, court/regulatory/law‑enforcement requests, and to protect safety and property
- Business transfers: as part of mergers, reorganizations, or asset transfers; recipients must honor this Policy or seek renewed consent
- Affiliates: only for purposes in this Policy, under equivalent safeguards

## 5. Legal bases (overview)

- Consent: precise location, personalized ads, non‑essential cookies/SDKs
- Contract: core features, subscriptions/purchases
- Legitimate interests: service security, product optimization, anti‑fraud (balanced against your rights)
- Legal obligations: to comply with applicable laws and requests

## 6. Cross‑border transfers

Your information may be processed or stored outside your country/region (e.g., Singapore, the United States, the EU/UK). We apply safeguards required by law (e.g., SCCs and supplemental measures) to ensure equivalent protection.

## 7. Security

We use transport encryption, access controls, least privilege, audits, and incident response. No method is 100% secure; keep your credentials safe.

## 8. Data retention

- Account and transactions: retained for the life of your account and for legal/accounting needs, then deleted or anonymized.
- Cloud‑processed content: kept for the minimum time needed to return results and optimize (typically ≤ 72 hours).
- Server logs/diagnostics: retained for security/troubleshooting (typically 21–180 days, per purpose).
- Biometric data (e.g., BIPA): deleted within three years of your last interaction or earlier if required by local law.

## 9. Your rights

Subject to law, you may request access/copies, rectification, deletion, withdrawal of consent, restriction or objection to processing, and data portability (where technically feasible). Contact support@lilivi.com; we may verify your identity before fulfilling requests.

## 10. Children’s privacy

We do not knowingly collect data from children under the age required by local law (e.g., under 16). If you believe we collected such data, contact support@lilivi.com for deletion.

## 11. Cookies and similar technologies

- Purposes: sessions, preferences, performance/UX, and (with consent) personalization/measurement.
- Controls: manage cookies/ad IDs in browser/OS settings; see our [Cookie Policy](/en/cookies). Strictly necessary cookies cannot be disabled.

### Consent management (EEA/UK)

- In consent‑first regions (EEA/UK), we only enable strictly necessary cookies/SDKs until consent, show non‑personalized ads (NPA) if consent is not granted, and limit analytics to essential aggregated measurements.
- The app integrates Google UMP/Consent SDK. You can change choices in privacy/settings (in‑app entry to be provided).

## 12. Regional addenda

## Appendix A: Mobile apps and store compliance (Apple / Google Play)

This appendix summarizes our approach for iOS and Android store disclosures (actual filings are made in the developer consoles).

- Tracking and ATT (iOS): If we use IDFA for ads/attribution or use third parties (e.g., Google Ads/AdMob) for cross‑app/site tracking, we request Apple ATT permission before accessing IDFA. If you deny, we won’t access IDFA; ads become non‑personalized and some measurement is limited.
- Ad personalization (Android): We honor system ad personalization and GAID settings; if you turn off or reset GAID, we do not use it for personalized ads.
- Minimal permissions: Camera, microphone, photos/media, notifications, Bluetooth, and location are requested only when a feature needs them; you can withdraw in OS settings at any time.
- Children and sensitive content: The app is not directed to users under 16; we do not target personalized ads to children.

### Third‑party SDKs (current plan)

- Firebase (Google): Analytics (aggregated analytics), Crashlytics (crash reports), Cloud Messaging (push token management, if provided).  
  Privacy: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy , https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Google Ads / AdMob: Ad delivery/measurement, frequency capping, anti‑fraud.  
  Privacy: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads

> These providers may process device identifiers (IDFA/GAID/Android ID/OAID), coarse location signals, IP, in‑app events, and crash logs. We configure data minimization and purpose limits per law and store policies.

#### Third‑party SDKs and processed data (details)

- Firebase Analytics
  - May process: event names and timestamps, app version/build, device model and OS version, region/language, first‑open/source attribution, session counts/durations, screen views and interaction events; if system allows ad identifiers/personalization, may read ad ID (IDFA/GAID).
  - Our handling: when consent is not given or ATT is denied, we disable access to ad ID and personalization signals and keep only necessary aggregated statistics; we honor system “limit ad tracking/reset ad ID”.
- Firebase Crashlytics
  - May process: crash stack traces, thread/device state, recent log snippets, app version/build, device model/OS version, crash time/frequency, strictly for stability analysis.
  - Our handling: used solely for diagnostics and quality improvement; not for ads or identifying specific individuals.
- Google Ads / AdMob
  - May process: advertising identifiers (IDFA/GAID/OAID), coarse location and IP, ad impressions/clicks/revenue, and frequency/anti‑fraud signals (e.g., deduplication, invalid traffic detection).
  - Our handling: when consent is not given or ATT is denied, we enable non‑personalized ads (NPA) and do not use IDFA for personalization; comply with restricted data processing and age policies; no child‑directed personalized ads.

#### Your controls (mobile)

- iOS: Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking (control “Allow Apps to Request to Track”); disable tracking for this app.
- Android: Settings → Google → Ads (reset advertising ID; turn off ad personalization).
- In‑app (to be provided):
  - Personalized ads toggle;
  - Analytics/diagnostics toggle;
  - Account/data deletion entry.

### App Store privacy labels (reference)

- Data used to track you: device identifiers (IDFA) [only if you allow ATT and only for ads/attribution].
- Data linked to you: email (account/support), identifiers (for security/abuse prevention/analytics), usage data (interactions), diagnostics (crash/performance).
- Not collected: health, financial account credentials, biometric templates, precise location (unless you explicitly grant).

### Google Play Data safety (reference)

- Collected: approximate location, app activity, app info and performance (crash/diagnostics), device or other IDs.
- Shared: only with processors for infrastructure, analytics, ads, and anti‑fraud (with consent or where legally permitted).
- Security practices: encryption in transit, least privilege, vendor compliance reviews.
- Data deletion: in‑app entry (to be provided) or by email to support@lilivi.com to request deletion/account deactivation.
- Optional vs required: Non‑core data can be disabled via settings or consent dialogs.

### User controls and toggles

- Personalized ads: disable in app (when available) or OS settings; via ATT on iOS and GAID settings on Android.
- Analytics/diagnostics: toggle in app privacy settings (when available).
- Account/data deletion: request by email; an in‑app “Account → Delete account” entry will be provided in a future version.
