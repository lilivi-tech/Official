Lilivi is committed to providing a clear refund policy to ensure a satisfactory experience. Please read this Refund Policy carefully before making a purchase.

Note: We do not offer direct website checkout. In‑app subscriptions are billed and managed by Apple App Store and Google Play; refunds follow store terms.

## 1. Auto‑renewal, Upgrade, Downgrade, Cancellation

- Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period.
- Upgrades take effect immediately, replace your current plan, and reset the billing cycle from the time of upgrade.
- Downgrades take effect after the current period ends; the new plan becomes active at the next renewal.
- On renewal, the system will charge based on your then‑active plan.
- You may cancel at any time via the billing page or by contacting support. We will stop charging for the next period; fees already paid are non‑refundable. You retain access until the end of the paid period.

## 2. Stopping Use Mid‑Term

If you stop using the software or services during a subscription period, the fees already paid for the remaining time are non‑refundable. We reserve the right to modify or terminate services at any time without prior notice.

## 3. Pay‑as‑You‑Go (Top‑Up/Credits)

Due to the nature of software licensing, fees paid for Pay‑as‑You‑Go credits are non‑refundable during the validity period, unless otherwise expressly stated in these terms.

### Rollover Limit (Top‑Up Pack)

If you choose a subscription plan, please note the rollover cap for Top‑Up Packs (e.g., “Rollover limit up to 5× annual credits under the active subscription plan,” as prominently displayed on the Top‑Up Pack order page). Fees paid are non‑refundable unless otherwise expressly stated.

## 4. Mid‑Term Cancellation

For subscription cancellations, we do not refund any portion of monthly or annual fees, even if a cancellation occurs mid‑term. Unless expressly stated otherwise, payment obligations cannot be canceled and amounts paid are non‑refundable.

## 5. Your Responsibility & Acceptance

You are responsible for familiarizing yourself with this Refund Policy. By purchasing subscriptions or credits, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these terms. If you cannot accept them, please refrain from placing an order.

## 6. App Store / Google Play Subscriptions — Refunds & Cancellations

In‑app subscriptions are billed and managed by Apple App Store / Google Play. Refunds follow the store’s Terms; we cannot directly refund store orders:

- iOS (iTunes/App Store):
  - Use Apple’s “Report a Problem”: on desktop, sign in with your Apple ID → Purchase History → locate the purchase → “Report a Problem” and select a reason.
  - On mobile: App Store → tap your profile (top right) → Purchase History → locate the transaction → “Report a Problem”.
- Android (Google Play):
  - Within 48 hours of the charge: request a refund directly from Google.
  - After 48 hours and within 10 days of the transaction date: email us with your Google Play order number (e.g., GPA.1234‑5678‑9012‑34567) and the purchasing email at [support@lilivi.com](mailto:support@lilivi.com). Subject: “Refund”.

Notes:

- Partially used subscription periods are generally non‑refundable.
- Cancel anytime in the App Store / Google Play subscription center; cancellation takes effect at the end of the paid period. Deleting the app does not cancel a subscription.
- Any cooling‑off/withdrawal rights provided by law or store policy will be honored.

## 7. How to Request Assistance (Website or Other Cases)

If you believe your case warrants an exception (e.g., erroneous duplicate charge), email [support@lilivi.com](mailto:support@lilivi.com) with your order ID, payment proof, and details. We typically review within 5–10 business days. Refund timelines depend on the payment channel.
