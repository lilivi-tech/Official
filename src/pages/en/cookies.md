Lilivi uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize your preferences and optimize website appearance and usability. This helps make our websites easier to navigate and more user‑friendly.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or mobile device. A cookie contains a unique identifier used to recognize your browser or device when you return to our website (the “Site”). Cookies may persist for different durations:

- “Temporary”/persistent cookies remain until their set expiration.
- “Session” cookies exist only while your browser is open and are deleted once you close it.

## What do we use cookies and web beacons for?

We use a variety of cookies for different purposes, including to enhance your experience on the Site and to better understand how the Site and our products are used. Cookies may tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Site before or whether you are a new visitor.

## What types of cookies are used by Lilivi?

We may use both first‑party and third‑party cookies. First‑party cookies are set directly by Lilivi. Third‑party cookies are set by service providers on our behalf and are commonly used for analytics and marketing. Representative third parties may include advertising providers (e.g., Google) and infrastructure providers. The specific list may change over time and is further outlined in our Privacy Policy.

We group cookies into the categories below:

1. Essential cookies — Necessary for the Site and product to operate (security, sessions, load balancing, core features). These cannot be switched off in our systems.

2. Analytics cookies — Collect information about how the Site is used so we can measure and improve performance (e.g., page views, navigation, device stats). These are typically provided by third parties.

3. Marketing cookies — Track browsing patterns to help us and partners show ads that are more relevant to you and to limit repetitive ads. These are provided by third parties.

### Examples (subject to change)

The presence, names, and lifetimes of cookies may vary by region, product version, and partner configuration.

## Your choices

- Manage cookies in your browser (block/delete)
- Use provider‑specific opt‑out tools (where offered)

### Consent & regional strategy (EEA/UK)

- We use Google UMP/Consent SDK for consent. Before consent, only strictly necessary cookies/SDKs run; ads are non‑personalized (NPA) and analytics are limited to essential aggregated measurements.

Note: Disabling some cookies may affect functionality and experience.
